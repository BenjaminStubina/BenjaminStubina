# Hello!

I'm Benjamin Stubina, a former Materials Science Engineer turned self-taught full-stack web developer from Canada. My passion for solving technical problems with creative solutions led me to pursue a career in software development. I take pride in the quality of the code I write and I'm always excited to learn from building projects and learning new technologies. I'm currently looking for a Jr/Internship frontend/full-stack role!

## Projects I'm working on:
- <ins>**[ExtraExtra](https://extra-extra-client.vercel.app/)**</ins>: Web app designed to bring news to Canadians who are no longer able to see the news on META social media platforms due to a ban imposed by META in response to the Online News Act passed by the Canadian Federal Government in July of 2023.
