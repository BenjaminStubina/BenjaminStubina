Hi, I'm Benjamin Stubina, a former Materials Science Engineer turned self-taught full-stack web developer from Canada. My passion for solving technical problems with creative solutions led me to pursue a career in software development. I take pride in the quality of the code I write and I'm always excited to learn from building projects and learning new technologies.

▪️ Completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp at [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io)

▪️ B.Eng in Materials Science and Engineering (Co-op) from McMaster University
<br/>
▪️ Spent 2 years working as a Thermal Processing Engineer at [Stackpole International](https://www.stackpole.com/)
