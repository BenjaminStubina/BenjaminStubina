## Projects I'm working on:
- **[ExtraExtra:](https://extraextranews.ca/)** Web app designed to bring news to Canadians who are no longer able to see the news on META social media platforms due to a ban imposed by META in response to the Online News Act passed by the Canadian Federal Government in July of 2023.
- **[Sabrina Fitness:](https://sabfit-training.com/)** A project for a client. Revamped her business website.
- **[Crochet Corner:](https://crochet-corner.com)** A refactored project I made as my capstone while at BrainStation related to learning to crochet.
